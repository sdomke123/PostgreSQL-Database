Using example employee data given in CSV files, data modeling, engineering, and analysis were demonstrated.

#### Data Modeling

An Entity Relationship Diagram was created to model the relationships between the CSVs used.

#### Data Engineering

A table schema was created for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

Each CSV file was imported into their corresponding SQL tables.

#### Data Analysis

Once the database was complete, the following were displayed using SQL queries:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
